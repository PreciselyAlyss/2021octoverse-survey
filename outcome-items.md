[^DORA]: We thank the DORA team for developing the measures used in the software delivery performance section of this survey
[^2]: This item didn’t load, which is typical for the DORA measures when used in constructs, which is consistent with prior research, see Accelerate 2018 and prior SODRs. All four measures are still predictive when used in a clustering classifier, see [2021 State of DevOps Report](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops) (registration required)
